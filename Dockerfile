# them as runtime variables alone leaves the client with `undefined` and the
# app cannot reach Supabase Auth. Both are publishable values, not secrets:
# the anon key is designed to ship to the browser and every table it can reach
# is behind row level security. Railway passes service variables to the build
# automatically; other hosts may need --build-arg.
